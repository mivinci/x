 * weak.h - Weak<T>: a non-owning, count-tracking handle to the same
 *          RcInner<T> that backs Rc<T>. Upgrade to Option<Rc<T>> on
 *          demand; the upgrade returns None if every strong has
 *          dropped.
 *
 *   sizeof(Weak<T>) == sizeof(T*)
 *
 * Design analogue: Rust's std::rc::Weak<T>. Like the Rust type,
 * Weak<T> in libx++ is allowed to be null (default constructed
 * yields null — no Option wrapper needed; the "absent" state IS the
 * type's identity). Constructing a Weak from an Rc bumps the inner's
 * weak count; dropping the Weak decrements it. Weak alone never
 * keeps the T alive — only Rc does. The inner's memory stays around
 * until the last Weak goes too, so upgrade() can still safely peek.
 *
 * ── Worked example: parent ⇄ child tree ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The canonical use of Weak<T> is breaking the cycle that appears
 * any time a tree node wants to walk back up to its parent. A
 * naive design ends up with strong both ways and leaks the tree on
 * drop:
 *
 *   //  BAD — strong cycle, never freed
 *   struct Node {
 *     Option<Rc<Node>>              parent;   // strong upward
 *     std::vector<Rc<Node>>         children; // strong downward
 *   };
 *
 *   Rc<Node> root  = Rc<Node>::make();
 *   Rc<Node> child = Rc<Node>::make();
 *   root->children.push_back(child);      // root → child  (root.strong = 1, child.strong = 2)
 *   child->parent  = Option<Rc<Node>>(root); // child → root (root.strong = 2)
 *
 *   // When `root` and `child` go out of scope each still has +1 from the
 *   // other; their strong counts never reach 0 and both nodes leak.
 *
 * Flip the back-edge to Weak and the cycle dissolves cleanly:
 *
 *   //  GOOD — Rc<Child>, Weak<Parent>
 *   struct Node {
 *     Weak<Node>                    parent;   // weak upward
 *     std::vector<Rc<Node>>         children; // strong downward
 *   };
 *
 *   Rc<Node> root  = Rc<Node>::make();
 *   Rc<Node> child = Rc<Node>::make();
 *   child->parent = Rc<Node>::downgrade(root);   // Weak does not bump strong
 *   root->children.push_back(std::move(child));
 *
 *   // root.strong_count() == 1, root.weak_count() == 1
 *   // child.strong_count() == 1 (held by root->children alone)
 *
 *   // To walk back up:
 *   if (Option<Rc<Node>> p = some_child->parent.upgrade()) {
 *     p.unwrap()->do_something();           // got a strong handle, parent alive
 *   } else {
 *     // parent already dropped; do nothing.
 *   }
 *
 *   // On `root` dropping, the strong count goes to 0, all children
 *   // are destroyed (releasing their Weak<Node> parent), and finally
 *   // the inner block is freed. No leak.
 *
 * Rule of thumb: in any **owner ↔ observer** pair, owner holds Rc,
 * observer holds Weak. parent ⇄ child, list-with-back-pointer, model
 * ⇄ view, callback registries — same pattern.
 *
 * For cross-thread cycle-breaking use ArcWeak<T> (see xpp/arc.h).
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Reading semantics:
 *   - default ctor / Weak{} → null
 *   - Weak(const Rc<T>&)    → observe; weak += 1
 *   - copy / move           → standard handle moves (copy → weak +=
 *                             1, move → unchanged)
 *   - upgrade() → Option<Rc<T>>: None if strong == 0, else Some(Rc).
 *     The strong is bumped under the existing weak's protection, so
 *     this is sound even if every visible Rc has dropped between
 *     the Weak's construction and the upgrade call.
 *
 * Thread safety: Weak<T> is single-thread. For thread-safe weak refs
 * use ArcWeak<T> in xpp/arc.h.
 *
 * C++11-compatible. Header-only.
