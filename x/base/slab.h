 * slab.h - Fixed-size object pool (slab allocator)
 *
 * xSlab carves large chunks of memory into fixed-size slots and hands
 * them out via an intrusive freelist.  It is designed to replace the
 * many small `calloc(1, sizeof(T))` / `free()` call sites scattered
 * throughout xbase where objects are allocated and freed at very high
 * frequency (event sources, timers, tree nodes, hash entries, ...).
 *
 * Two variants are provided:
 *
 *   xSlab    — single-threaded, zero synchronisation overhead.
 *              Use this when the pool is owned by a single thread
 *              (e.g. an event loop's internal bookkeeping).
 *
 *   xSlabMt  — multi-threaded, lock-free Treiber stack freelist.
 *              Use this when allocations and frees may come from
 *              different threads (e.g. cross-thread work submission).
 *
 * Both variants:
 *   - Never shrink or return individual slots to the system.  Memory
 *     is only released when the pool itself is destroyed.
 *   - Return uninitialised memory (callers should memset if they
 *     previously relied on calloc's zeroing).
 *   - Honour a configurable alignment (default 16 bytes).
 *
 * Large chunks are acquired via the platform's native anonymous
 * mapping facility when available (mmap on POSIX, VirtualAlloc on
 * Windows) and fall back to malloc otherwise.
